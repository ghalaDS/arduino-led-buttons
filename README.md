# arduino-led-buttons
This project controls LEDs using push buttons on Arduino UNO.

A simple interactive Arduino UNO project to control 3 LEDs (Blue, Red, Yellow) using 3 push buttons.  
Each button is wired to either turn ON or OFF a specific LED.

# Arduino Code Example

This example turns a single LED (connected to pin 9) ON and OFF with delay.
For the full button logic, refer to the `led_control.ino` file.

```cpp
const int blueLed = 9;

void setup() {
  pinMode(blueLed, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  digitalWrite(blueLed, HIGH);
  delay(500);
  digitalWrite(blueLed, LOW);
  delay(500);
}
